Dataset: from https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/25/9/1795/1295350
Original: 44 mammals and 3 other vertebrates
However, 6 mammals and 1 other vertebtrate are removed to reduce the size of data.
Removed are: Colobus_monkey, macaque, muntjak_indian, vervet, galago, st_squirrel, and other vertebrates(zfish, fugu)
Might be Useful info from original paper:
 1. all sequences orthologous to a 1.9-Mb region of human chromosome 7 (build hg18, chr7:115,597,757â€“117,475,182) that includes 10 known genes (e.g., CFTR, ST7, and CAV1)
2.  all seq: 
        a) isolating bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones from the orthologous genomic region using overgo-based hybridization methods (Thomas et al. 2002) 
        b) generating high-quality sequence of each selected BAC (Blakesley et al. 2004)
        c) sets of overlapping BAC sequences were compiled into a single ordered and oriented sequence
        d) assembled BAC sequences are provided as supplementary data online (available at http://www.nisc.nih.gov/data)

Aligning my data HW
    All 37 sequences were pasted into one file: Desktop/MiZ/data/Original Data File/
    I confirmed that all sequences are pasted into thhat file by searching all the names of the species in the file
